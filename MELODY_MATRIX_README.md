## 🔌 API Integration

Currently using **mock implementation** for offline development.

### To Connect Real Beatoven API:

1. Add environment variables:
```env
VITE_BEATOVEN_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_BEATOVEN_API_URL=https://api.beatoven.ai
```

2. Update `src/services/beatoven.ts`:
   - Replace mock functions with real API calls
   - Follow the compose → poll → download workflow
   - See code comments for detailed implementation notes

## 🎯 State Management

Using **Zustand** with persistence:
- Assessment state persists across page reloads
- Wizard navigation state
- User selections and generated tracks
- Reset functionality

## ✨ Animations

- Fade-in, scale, and slide transitions
- Gradient shifts on hero text
- Hover effects on cards
- Pulse glow on active elements
- Confetti on music generation success

## 🎨 Design System Tokens

All colors, shadows, and gradients defined in:
- `src/index.css` - CSS variables
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Tailwind extensions

**Never use hardcoded colors!** Always use semantic tokens:
- ✅ `bg-primary` `text-secondary`
- ❌ `bg-purple-500` `text-pink-400`

## 🧪 Testing

Built-in console logging for API calls and state changes.

Recommended testing flow:
1. Navigate through all wizard steps
2. Try different issue/instrument combinations
3. Test audio playback
4. Verify state persistence (refresh page mid-wizard)
5. Test responsive layouts on mobile

## 📱 Responsive Design

Breakpoints follow Tailwind defaults:
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

All layouts adapt fluidly with mobile-first approach.

## 🚀 Production Deployment

1. Update `beatoven.ts` with real API integration
2. Set environment variables
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Deploy `dist/` folder to your hosting platform

## 🎵 Future Enhancements

- User accounts and saved tracks
- Social sharing of music
- Expanded instrument library
- Playlist creation
- Progress tracking over time
- Integration with wearables
